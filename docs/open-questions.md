# Open questions

_Last updated: 2026-10-17_

Decisions not yet made. When one is resolved, write an ADR, link it in the **Resolved** table and remove the row from **Open**.

## Open

| ID | Question | Options | Needed by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q4 | Symbolic equation parsing | Rust-native parser and symbolic crate; SymPy via Python; Julia Symbolics service | Symbolic equation entry | Affects dependencies and startup |
| Q5 | Algebraic loops in fused groups | Causalisation and tearing; Newton solve per RHS evaluation; forbid and warn | Phase 1 | Current v0 restriction: no direct feedthrough |
| Q11 | Which views a model offers | (a) every registered view whose slots the signals can fill (today); (b) only the views the model file lists; (c) the file's views first, the other fitting views behind "More views…"; plus stricter fit rules from units and port roles | Views step 3 (several views at once) | Raised by the owner 2026-10-17. Recommendation (c): the author curates what is shown, generic views stay available for exploring, and domain views (e.g. a pendulum drawing) only fit their own block types |
